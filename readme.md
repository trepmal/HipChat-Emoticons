# HipChat Emoticons

First, run `hipupdate` in Alfred. This will launch the Workflow folder in Finder. Create a file called `apikey` that contains nothing but your HipChat API key (must have view_group scope).

Run `hipupdate` again to begin fetching icons. Please note this could take a while and may need to be run a few times depending on how many emoticons you have.

Once you have your emoticons, `hc` will list all of them, and `hc {query}` will only show those that contain a match.
